INSTALLING CHPP
---------------

CHPP currently supports the following configurations through
the configure script:

    gnu-linux-i386
    gnu-linux-alpha
    gnu-linux-powerpc
    openstep-i386
    digitalunix-alpha

Building CHPP on other platforms should not be a problem, since
it is written very portably and does not use a lot of platform
dependent features. Just try one of the configurations and see
how it goes.

One big problem on some uncommon architecture may be the garbage
collector located in directory gc/. Although it runs on a lot of
platforms out-of-the-box, you may have to change the Makefile to make
it run on your machine. On some machines it may never run.

Be sure you have GNU make, flex and GNU bison installed.

Change to the directory you have unpacked CHPP in:

    cd chpp-0.3

Use the configure script to choose the platform you want to build on.
configure recognizes the following configuration names:

    linux       GNU/Linux
    next        NEXTSTEP, OPENSTEP
    dgux        Digital UNIX

For example, type

    ./configure linux

If you want to have support for the mSQL or MySQL databases, edit the
Makefile and uncomment the corresponding lines.

Now, just call GNU make, i.e.

    make

If CHPP builds without errors, you should run the regress tests, just
to make sure everything is fine:

    cd test/regress
    ./dotest

If all tests pass, change back to the main directory and install CHPP.
In this release, CHPP relies on being installed in /usr/local.

    cd ../..
    make install

Now you are set! Documentation in Texinfo format is contained in the
directory doc/. HTML-format documentation can be found in doc/html/.

Happy CHPPing
