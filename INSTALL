INSTALLING CHPP
===============

CHPP is configured and installed using the configure script.
It has been tested on the following platforms:

    gnu-linux-i386
    gnu-linux-powerpc
    gnu-linux-alpha
    digitalunix-alpha
    openstep-i386
    aix-rs6000

It should work on similar platforms without much problems.  Please
report any success or failure in building CHPP on other platforms
(mail to chpp@unix.cslab.tuwien.ac.at).

One big problem on some uncommon architecture may be the garbage
collector located in directory gc/. Although it runs on a lot of
platforms out-of-the-box, you may have to change the Makefile to make
it run on your machine. On some machines it may never run.

Change to the directory you have unpacked CHPP in:

    cd chpp-0.3.2

Start the configure script to determine your platform parameters:

    ./configure

If you want CHPP installed in a place other than /usr/local you have
to tell configure where it should be installed, using the option
--prefix. For example, to install CHPP in /opt (binary in /opt/bin,
includes in /opt/lib/chpp/include), call

    ./configure --prefix=/opt

If configure fails, something is wrong. In case you cannot fix it for
yourself please drop us a mail.

In case everything went right, just call make, i.e. type:

    make

If CHPP builds without errors, you should run the regress tests, just
to make sure everything is fine:

    cd test/regress
    ./dotest

If all tests pass, change back to the main directory and install CHPP.
In this release, CHPP relies on being installed in /usr/local.

    cd ../..
    make install

Now you are set! Documentation in Texinfo format is contained in the
directory doc/. The Info documentation is installed automatically. You can
produce a PostScript version of the documentation with

    cd doc
    make chpp.ps

if you have a working TeX distribution installed.

Happy CHPPing
