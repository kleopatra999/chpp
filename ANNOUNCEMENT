    CHPP Version 0.3.1
    ==================


CHPP is a powerful preprocessor originally designed for, but not
limited to, HTML.

We have used CHPP successfully in the creation of simple and complex
web-pages, web-databases, QuakeWorld (tm) configuration files and data
processing tasks usually done with tools like GAWK.


Features
--------

CHPP combines features of CPP, M4, Perl and Scheme. Still, we have
tried and succeeded in keeping the language pretty simple.

Among the features of CHPP are:

    - CHPP is non-intrusive, i.e. you can take already existing text and
      just pipe it through CHPP and it is likely it won't change.

    - User-defined macros, which can be recursive

    - Complex data structures (lists and hashes)

    - Powerful looping constructs

    - Regular expression matching

    - Support for CGI scripting

    - An interface to SQL-Servers (at the moment mSQL and MySQL).


Documentation
-------------

A reference manual for CHPP is included in the distribution.


Platforms
---------

Our main development platform for CHPP is gnu-linux-i386. CHPP has
been tested on the following platforms:

    gnu-linux-i386
    gnu-linux-powerpc
    gnu-linux-alpha
    digitalunix-alpha

There are two CHPP mailing lists:

  chpp-announce@mondoshawan.unix.cslab.tuwien.ac.at
                      Announcements regarding CHPP.
  chpp-general@mondoshawan.unix.cslab.tuwien.ac.at
                      Discussions about using CHPP, bug reports,
                      development of CHPP etc.

Everything that gets posted to chpp-announce gets posted to
chpp-general too, so you only have to subscribe to one list.  To
