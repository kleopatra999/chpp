    CHPP Version 0.3
    ================


CHPP is a powerful preprocessor originally designed for, but not
limited to, HTML.

We have used CHPP successfully in the creation of simple and complex
web-pages, QuakeWorld (tm) configuration files and data processing
tasks usually done with tools like GAWK.


Features
--------

CHPP combines features of CPP, M4, Perl and Scheme. Still, we have
tried and succeeded in keeping the language pretty simple.

Among the features of CHPP are:

    - CHPP is non-intrusive, i.e. you can take already existing text and
      just pipe it through CHPP and it is likely it won't change.

    - User-defined macros, which can be recursive

    - Complex data structures (lists and hashes)

    - Powerful looping constructs

    - Regular expression matching

    - Support for CGI scripting

    - An interface to SQL-Servers (at the moment mSQL and MySQL).


Documentation
-------------

A reference manual for CHPP is included in the distribution.


Platforms
---------

Our main development platform for CHPP is linux-i386. CHPP has been
tested on the following platforms:

    linux-i386
    linux-alpha
    linux-powerpc
    openstep-i386
    digitalunix-alpha

CHPP is written very portably and should compile and run out-of-the-box
on pretty much any UN*X platform, provided that the tools required for
building it (GNU make, flex, bison) are available.
